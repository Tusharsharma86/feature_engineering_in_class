Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive.

## Project
Iowa Dataset

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset will help you determine aspects which influence price of a property other than sq.ft. area and locality.

Make your first prediction with our favourite ML algorithm!
